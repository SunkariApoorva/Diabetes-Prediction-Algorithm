# Diabetes-Prediction-Algorithm
The Diabetes Dataset involves predicting the onset of diabetes within 5 years, given medical details.  It is a binary classification problem and the two classes signify:  Yes, diabetes will show up within next 5 years No, diabetes will not show up within next 5 years The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 768 observations with 8 input variables and 1 output variable.  The variable names are as follows:  Number of times pregnant. Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test. Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg). Triceps skinfold thickness (mm). 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml). Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2). Diabetes pedigree function. Age (years). Class variable (0 or 1).
